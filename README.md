### Introduction
This repository includes the analytical code that was used in two Human Rights Watch investigations into the rights to electricity, food, and social protection in Lebanon. This repository includes anonymized raw data that was used in the analysis and processing and analytical code used to produce our findings.

### Data
The analysis is based on data collected through a large probability survey. Human Rights Watch administered a household survey to a representative sample of 1,219 Lebanese households. We partnered with a local research firm, the Consultation and Research Institute (CRI), to develop the research design and survey instrument and carry out the survey between late November 2021 and January 2022. The methodology for the survey is described in detail in both Human Rights Watch reports. 

The folder "import/doc" includes the sampling methodology, the survey questionnaire and the data dictionary.

The folder "import/input" contains a file with the survey data. All personal identifiable information has been removed from this public data set. 

### Analysis
The repository includes two R scripts that were used for the analysis: one for processing and one for running the descriptive analyses. The processing script must be run before the descriptives script.

These scripts produce the findings that are included in both Human Rights Watch reports.
